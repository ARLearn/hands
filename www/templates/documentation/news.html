                            <p>Hi there,</p>

                            <p>As you probably noticed, we have deployed our brand new Authoring environment.
                                For those who were here before: the old version dates from 2011.
                                In those days, the google web toolkit (GWT) seemed like a fair choice to develop a web based application.
                                Nowadays, the Internet is full of responsive web applications. AngularJS and bootstrap are appealing techniques to rebuild this site.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                By building on these technologies we have a lot more -javascript- based frameworks that we can integrate.
                                You might already have noticed the Vis.js implementation of the dependency graph. This is a feature that many users have requested since long.
                                We are currently looking in to further easing the way dependencies can be visualized and created.
                                As an example, we are currently investigating whether <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly/">Google Blocky</a> can be used to develop dependencies.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I hope this transition to this new infrastructure won't cause to much pain. And if harm is done, don't hesitate to contact us.
                            </p>
